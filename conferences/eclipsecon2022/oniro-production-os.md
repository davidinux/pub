# Dining philosophers?

## Lack of devices | Lack of end users | Lack of applications 

---

# Problem definition

  * Technology fragmentation, yet similar components (linux, zephyr, java, qt, ...)
  * Pre-existing investments: infrastructure, code, tools
  *
---

# The role of open source (thus far)

  * Innovation engine
  * Developers oriented: code, documentation, tutorials,...
  * Faster time to market
  * Lower cost of expertise

# Production oriented open source

  * Roadmap predictability
  * Lifecycle predicablity
  * Opinionated defaults: reference images as opposed to collection of libraries
  * Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, Continuous Validation, Continuous Compliance
  * Compliance envelop: production artifacts such as V&V reports, SWBOM
  * Bug and CVE policies with Service Level Agreements
